####Exam details:
In the initial, I create a new Next.js project and connect the mongoDB, install some command that I will use in next work. Basically, almost the code comes from what the teacher taught us to do in class and I I made a few changes to that base. For the UI, I put the "style" inline, it's a little cumbersome, but it's less error-prone. When I finish the exam, I have some problem with updating. It always shows "500 error", so I change the "fetch" and use the new import which is called "axios", then it can be work in vercel.


####Function description:
One table with "Update" and "Delete" function which is a button you can click. You can update or delete the data of this line. And it also have the "Add new suppliers" function which is a button you can add the new data. After you finish the adding work, you will see the new supplier data in the index page. It also have the "Back" button that you can go back to the index page.
